# 9. Extensibility Framework

## 9.1 Extension Points and Module Registration

The specification must remain open to new models, connectors, and orchestration primitives. Extensibility hinges on clearly defined hooks where additional modules can register without modifying the core schema. This subsection outlines how extension authors declare themselves and how engines discover, validate, and sandbox these contributions. Readers can think of extensions as officially sanctioned add-ons: they snap into designated ports, announce their capabilities, and run within guardrails so core workflows remain stable.

Requirements:

- **Module Manifest** — Extensions Must publish a manifest describing provided step types, capability tags, configuration schemas, and compatibility ranges (core spec version, dependency versions). Manifests Should be signed or checksum-verified to prevent tampering.
- **Registration Protocol** — Engines Must support a registration protocol (e.g., manifest import, plugin loader API) that validates manifests, resolves dependency conflicts, and activates extensions in a deterministic order.
- **Sandboxing and Isolation** — Extensions that execute code Must declare security boundaries. Engines Must isolate extensions (process isolation, resource quotas) to prevent cross-workflow interference.
- **Capability Bridging** — When extensions adapt external systems into existing capability categories, they Must document mapping semantics so workflows understand behavioral nuances compared to built-in implementations.
- **Documentation Hooks** — Extension manifests Should include links to documentation, support contacts, and example workflows, enabling authoring tools to surface rich metadata to end users.

## 9.2 Capability Negotiation and Feature Flags

Different runtimes and extensions may support different feature sets. Capability negotiation ensures that workflows declare what they need, engines advertise what they offer, and both sides converge on a compatible set at execution time. This negotiation acts like a pre-flight checklist, confirming that the runtime and workflow agree on the features that will be used before the run takes off.

Requirements:

- **Negotiation Handshake** — Prior to execution, engines Must perform a handshake comparing workflow-declared capabilities against runtime-supported capabilities and enabled extensions. Incompatible workflows Must fail fast with actionable diagnostics.
- **Feature Flags** — Workflows May gate experimental steps behind feature flags. Flags Must specify default states, rollout cohorts, and fallback behaviors. Engines Must persist flag evaluations per execution to keep behavior deterministic.
- **Capability Downgrades** — When a requested capability is unavailable, workflows Should provide downgrade paths (alternate models, reduced functionality). Engines Must document which downgrade was applied and log the resulting behavioral differences.
- **Runtime Capability Profiles** — Engines Should expose capability profiles describing the aggregate features available in each deployment environment. Workflows referencing a profile Must verify compatibility during deployment validation.
- **Conflict Resolution** — If multiple extensions attempt to claim the same capability with different semantics, engines Must enforce precedence rules defined by policy (e.g., organization-specific allowlists) and Must surface conflicts to operators.

## 9.3 Compatibility Guarantees and Deprecation Policy

Extensibility is sustainable only if new capabilities do not break existing workflows. The specification therefore codifies compatibility expectations and a structured deprecation lifecycle so implementers can innovate without disrupting production automations. These clauses function as a treaty between extension authors and operators, spelling out how change happens without sacrificing trust.

Requirements:

- **Semantic Versioning** — Extensions and workflow bundles Must follow semantic versioning so consumers can infer compatibility. Breaking changes Must increment the major version and Must provide migration guides.
- **Backward-Compatibility Tests** — Extension authors Should ship regression test suites covering supported spec versions. Engines incorporating extensions Must run these suites during upgrade workflows.
- **Deprecation Announcements** — When retiring features, extension authors Must publish deprecation notices, timelines, and suggested alternatives. Engines Must propagate these notices to workflow owners and track remediation status.
- **Compatibility Contracts** — The core specification Should publish compatibility contracts describing which versions of extensions or capability profiles are considered stable. Engines Must refuse to run combinations outside these contracts unless explicitly overridden.
- **Fallback Guarantees** — Workflows May declare required fallback guarantees (e.g., must maintain data shape even when downgraded). Engines Must respect these guarantees or fail deployment if they cannot be met.

By formalizing extension points, negotiation, and compatibility rules, the specification stays adaptable while keeping cross-runtime behavior predictable. Annex G showcases an analytics extension module that walks through manifest registration, capability negotiation, and safe deprecation.
