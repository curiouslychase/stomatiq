# üìñ Stomatiq Content Categories Strategy

## 1. **Future Laws & Frameworks**

**Description:**
Big, conceptual essays that declare new "laws of work physics" in the AI era. These pieces make bold claims, introduce new equations or frameworks, and reframe how readers think about productivity, work, and creation in a world reshaped by AI.

* **Tone:** Visionary, provocative, epoch-shifting.
* **Reader Outcome:** Leave feeling like they understand the new rules of the game ‚Äî and that old assumptions no longer apply.
* **Examples:**

  * *Is One the New Many?*
  * *The New Maker Schedule Isn‚Äôt About Making*
  * *The Automation Curve ‚Äì From Tasks to Workflows to Systems*

---

## 2. **Thriving Playbooks**

**Description:**
Step-by-step, practical guides that show readers how to **adapt and thrive** under the new laws. These pieces translate abstract ideas into concrete practices, tools, and checklists that solo builders, prosumers, and workflow creators can apply immediately.

* **Tone:** Clear, empowering, tactical.
* **Reader Outcome:** Leave with a practical process, checklist, or method they can start using today.
* **Examples:**

  * *The Prompt Communication Playbook ‚Äì How to Direct Systems with Clarity*
  * *Systems for Self-Evident Decisions*
  * *How to Build Your First AI Workflow (Without Code)*

---

## 3. **Technical Deep Dives**

**Description:**
Detailed, developer-focused explorations of **how AI workflows actually work**. These posts explain the mechanics, patterns, code-level examples, and architecture that make automations reliable, modular, and scalable.

* **Tone:** Technical, precise, pragmatic.
* **Reader Outcome:** Leave with a clear mental model or implementation example they can replicate in code.
* **Examples:**

  * *Structured Output ‚Äì What It Is, Why It Matters, and When to Use It*
  * *The Workflow Engine Pattern ‚Äì Building Reusable Automation Blocks with AI*
  * *Sensible Defaults for Claude Code Permissions*

---

## 4. **Case Studies**

**Description:**
Narrative-driven explorations that show **real-world examples** of people or companies thriving with AI workflows. These stories make abstract principles tangible by grounding them in lived experience.

* **Tone:** Relatable, narrative, reflective.
* **Reader Outcome:** Leave with a sense of ‚ÄúI can see myself in this‚Äù and inspired to apply similar workflows.
* **Examples:**

  * *Case Study ‚Äì A Week in the Life with 10 AI Workflows Running*
  * *How a Solo Creator Runs Their Entire Business on AI Workflows*

---

## 5. **Human Side & Philosophy**

**Description:**
Explorations of the **psychological, cultural, and existential** impacts of the AI shift. These pieces tackle meaning, isolation, craft, and purpose in an age where AI handles execution and humans orchestrate.

* **Tone:** Reflective, empathetic, slightly provocative.
* **Reader Outcome:** Leave with new perspective on how AI changes not just work, but human identity.
* **Examples:**

  * *Craft Without Touch ‚Äì How to Find Meaning When You Don‚Äôt Make*
  * *The End of Busywork: Why Automations Erase the Work We Pretended Was Work*

---

## 6. **AI Workflow Automation**

**Description:**
The bridge between Future Laws and Technical Deep Dives ‚Äî posts dedicated to **automation strategy**. These explain how AI workflows replace coordination, why declarative automation matters, and how prosumers can design their own personal automation stacks.

* **Tone:** Strategic + semi-technical. Accessible to prosumers but rigorous enough for workflow builders.
* **Reader Outcome:** Leave with clarity on what automations are possible today and how to start building.
* **Examples:**

  * *APIs Over Meetings ‚Äì Why Automations Replace Coordination*
  * *The Workflow Debugger ‚Äì Fixing Broken AI Chains Without Losing Your Mind*
  * *The Automation Curve ‚Äì From Tasks to Workflows to Systems*
