# Principles for Work, AI, and Technology

## On Work

1. **Leverage over Labor** – The most valuable work reduces repetitive effort and unlocks higher-leverage, creative, and socially valuable contributions.
2. **Automate to Elevate** – Automating the low-level, boring stuff creates space for people to focus on what only humans can uniquely do.
3. **Imagination as a Driver** – Work is about directing vision and ideas into reality, not simply grinding through execution.
4. **Collaboration First** – The best work is collaborative—humans plus tools, humans plus humans—rather than solitary struggle.
5. **Practical Purpose** – Work should align with meaningful outcomes, not just activity or output for its own sake.

## On AI

6. **AI as a Collaborator, Not a Replacement** – AI should serve as a creative partner or assistant, helping people articulate and realize their ideas rather than trying to replace skilled human creators.
7. **Structured Guidance Matters** – AI agents produce average or sloppy results when given too much autonomy; tight definitions, clear steps, and structured inputs unlock quality.
8. **Declarative Over Procedural** – Workflows should be defined declaratively (“what we want”) rather than procedurally (“every step”), enabling AI to flexibly handle execution while humans set intent.
9. **Human-in-the-Loop Is Essential** – Oversight, direction, and iteration by humans are necessary for AI outputs to meet real standards of quality and imagination.
10. **Empower Workflow Creators** – AI’s promise lies in enabling builders—especially those building for consumers/prosumers—to create powerful, personalized automations without deep technical barriers.

## On Technology

11. **Tools for People, Not Just Enterprises** – Technology should empower individuals, not only optimize for businesses.
12. **Abstraction as Power** – The best technologies hide unnecessary complexity while giving users control over intent.
13. **Scaling Ideas, Not Just Code** – Technology’s real power is in making it easier for visionaries to scale their ideas, not just scale technical systems.
14. **Transparency Builds Trust** – Systems should be understandable and interpretable by their users, not black boxes.
15. **Simplicity Unlocks Adoption** – The simpler a tool is to understand and use, the more it unlocks imagination and creativity in others.
