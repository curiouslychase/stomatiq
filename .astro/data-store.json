Specification Fundamentals\n\n## 2.1 Design Goals and Principles\n\nThis subsection articulates the foundational expectations that any conformant automation engine Must uphold when interpreting the specification. The goals frame how declarative workflow intents are preserved across heterogeneous runtimes, ensuring that probabilistic AI behaviors, deterministic integrations, and human interventions can coexist without sacrificing reliability, observability, or portability. They also inform how tooling should serialize, lint, and visualize workflows so that design intent remains intact during implementation. Stated plainly, the principles translate to a promise that different vendors can read the same workflow file, make consistent execution decisions, and give humans clear checkpoints when automation needs oversight.\n\nKey principles:\n\n- **Declarative Intent** — Workflows Must describe desired outcomes, invariants, and dependencies without binding to a single execution strategy, ensuring authors describe the “what” while engines decide the “how.” Engines May re-order or parallelize steps provided declared constraints are honored.\n- **Deterministic Interfaces for Probabilistic Systems** — Steps that rely on stochastic components (e.g., language models) Must expose deterministic data contracts, post-processing rules, and fallback behaviors so downstream nodes receive predictable structures and operators avoid ad-hoc parsing fixes.\n- **Typed, Composable Building Blocks** — Every step Must declare machine-verifiable input and output schemas, enabling static validation, automated UI generation, and safe reuse, allowing teams to assemble new workflows by snapping together trusted parts.\n- **Explicit State and Side Effects** — Workflows Must declare which steps mutate external systems, what state is persisted between runs, and how idempotency is ensured. Engines Should provide sandboxed evaluation modes to simulate side effects where feasible so authors can rehearse runs before touching production data.\n- **Human + AI Collaboration** — Human-in-the-loop interactions are first-class. Specifications Must allow checkpoints, approvals, and exception handling to be defined alongside automated steps, with clear escalation paths and auditability so human reviewers know when and why they are paged.\n- **Observability and Governance by Design** — Conformant workflows Must emit structured telemetry and reference applicable policies (security, privacy, compliance). Runtimes Should enable trace correlation across steps and honor per-step guardrails such as rate limits or content filters, turning governance requirements into executable controls.\n- **Extensibility Without Breakage** — Capability catalogs, metadata vocabularies, and schema definitions Must be forward-compatible. New step types Should be introducible via negotiated feature flags, leaving existing workflows unaffected even as the ecosystem grows.\n- **Portability Across Runtimes** — Specifications Must avoid runtime-specific code constructs. When a workflow depends on a capability not universally available, it Must provide a declared alternative or graceful degradation path so the same artifact can run in constrained environments.\n\n## 2.2 Workflow Model Overview\n\nThe workflow model is intentionally layered so that metadata, topology, contracts, and execution policies can evolve semi-independently. This separation allows authoring tools to focus on structure while runtimes emphasize operational guarantees. Viewed from a reader’s perspective, the layers help designers reason about intent, engineers consider execution wiring, and operators enforce controls without stepping on one another’s edits.\n\nConceptual layers:\n\n- **Metadata Layer** — Identifies the workflow (name, description, ownership, version), declares required capabilities, and links to governance artifacts (policies, compliance tags). Metadata Must be immutable once published to guarantee traceability.\n- **Topology Layer** — Describes the execution graph as a set of steps and edges. Steps reference step definitions by stable identifiers; edges encode sequencing, parallelism, and conditional routing. The topology Must be acyclic unless explicit loop constructs are declared with termination criteria.\n- **Contract Layer** — Captures per-step input/output schemas, contextual bindings, and default parameterization. Contracts Should reuse shared schema fragments to promote interoperability and must align with the Result Pattern for conveying success, warnings, or errors.\n- **Execution Policy Layer** — Specifies operational concerns: retry policies, timeout bounds, compensation handlers, security scopes, and observability requirements. Policies May be inherited from global defaults but Must be overrideable on a per-step basis.\n\nState flows through the graph as typed payloads. Engines Must persist state transitions sufficient for replay, auditing, and resuming from human checkpoints. When steps call external systems, the workflow Should capture correlation identifiers so telemetry can be stitched end-to-end. A worked example in Annex A shows how these layers combine when modeling a customer-support triage workflow.\n\n## 2.3 Normative Language Conventions\n\nNormative statements must be interpreted consistently regardless of authoring context—whether the spec is encoded as JSON, YAML, or a domain-specific language. To that end, this document standardizes keywords, annotations, and error envelopes. Readers can treat this section as the rulebook for parsing directive language before diving into specific clauses.\n\nConvention summary:\n\n- **Capitalized Keywords** — \"Must\", \"Must Not\", \"Should\", \"Should Not\", and \"May\" follow RFC 2119 interpretations. When combined with conditionals (e.g., \"If a step is HITL, it Must ...\"), the requirement applies only when the condition is met.\n- **Informative Notes** — Text labeled as \"Note\" or examples are non-normative, intended to clarify possible implementations. Deviations from examples are permitted if normative clauses are satisfied.\n- **Profiles and Extensions** — Optional capability sets are described as profiles. A workflow declaring a profile Must adhere to its additional rules. Engines lacking a profile May still execute the workflow if an alternate capability path is defined.\n- **Error Classifications** — The Result Pattern distinguishes `ok`, `recoverable_error`, and `fatal_error`. Normative statements referencing these identifiers impose requirements on how engines propagate each class.\n- **Schema References** — When schemas are cited, they are treated as normative unless explicitly marked \"informative sample\". Implementations Must validate payloads against referenced normative schemas prior to step execution.\n\nAll conformance claims are evaluated against these conventions. Where ambiguity arises, interpret clauses in favor of interoperability and safety.","src/content/ai-workflow-open-spec/03-specification-fundamentals.md","9ad7ccaf3b70c313",{"html":101,"metadata":102},"\u003Ch1 id=\"2-specification-fundamentals\">2.

Integration and Connectivity Layer\n\n## 5.1 Connector Metadata and Discovery\n\nWorkflows often rely on heterogeneous external systems—datastores, SaaS APIs, knowledge bases—to supply data or trigger side effects. To keep these integrations portable, connectors must describe themselves in a way that authoring tools can discover, parameterize, and validate regardless of the hosting runtime. This subsection defines the descriptive metadata that every connector publishes so workflows can bind to them declaratively. For readers, the connector descriptor is the brochure that tells you what the integration does, which paperwork is required, and how to plug it into your automation without unexpected surprises.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Connector Descriptor** — Each connector Must provide a descriptor containing identifier, human-readable name, capability tags, supported operations, authentication modes, and version information. Descriptors Should be retrievable via a registry or service directory exposed through an interoperable protocol (e.g., OpenAPI, JSON manifest).\n- **Operation Signatures** — Operations Must declare input/output schemas, rate-limit characteristics, timeout expectations, and side-effect classifications. Optional fields (pagination cursors, delta tokens) Should include defaults or negotiation hints.\n- **Discovery Filters** — Registries May expose filters by capability, compliance category, or data residency. Engines Must respect filter constraints when resolving connectors for a workflow, failing fast if no compliant connector exists.\n- **Deprecation Notices** — Connectors Must announce deprecation timelines with alternative recommendations. Workflows referencing deprecated connectors Should receive lint warnings and Must provide migration plans before the end-of-life date.\n- **Documentation References** — Descriptors Should link to human-facing documentation and example payloads. Engines that auto-generate UIs May surface these references to guide non-technical builders.\n\n## 5.2 External API Interaction Patterns\n\nOnce a workflow binds to a connector, it needs to express how requests are formed, dispatched, and reconciled with workflow state. The goal is to remove runtime-specific HTTP or RPC code while keeping enough structure for engines to optimize retries, logging, and parallel execution. You can think of this section as the script that every integration step follows so different runtimes can play the same scene without improvising the details.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Request Blueprint** — Each integration step Must define a blueprint describing HTTP or RPC method, endpoint template, headers, body schema, and serialization rules. Blueprints Must support templating via workflow context (e.g., parameter substitution, secret resolution).\n- **Response Handling** — Steps Must declare response parsing logic aligned with declared schemas, including error-class mapping. Engines Must surface unexpected responses as recoverable or fatal errors according to policy, capturing raw payloads for audit when permitted.\n- **Idempotency Keys** — For state-changing operations, workflows Should specify idempotency keys derived from business identifiers. Engines Must propagate these keys to connectors that support idempotent semantics and Must document fallback strategies when providers lack native support.\n- **Pagination and Streaming** — When operations return paginated or streaming data, the blueprint Must define continuation mechanics. Engines Should encapsulate pagination loops as explicit control-flow constructs rather than opaque handler code.\n- **Rate-Limit Awareness** — Steps Must include declared rate-limit ceilings and backoff strategies. Engines Must throttle requests accordingly and emit telemetry when approaching limits.\n\n## 5.3 Credential and Secret Management\n\nIntegrations cannot be secure without a robust approach to secret distribution and rotation. The specification mandates clear separation between workflow definitions and sensitive material, while giving executors hooks to fetch credentials securely at runtime. Put another way, workflows carry the map to a secret, not the secret itself, and engines are responsible for retrieving it just-in-time under strict supervision.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Secret References** — Workflow definitions Must reference secrets by logical identifiers (e.g., `secret://crm/api-key`) rather than embedding raw values. Engines Must resolve these references via approved secret stores at execution time.\n- **Scope Declarations** — Each integration step Must specify the scopes or permissions it requires. Engines Must verify that the retrieved credential grants those scopes before callout, failing with a fatal error otherwise.\n- **Rotation Policies** — Connectors Should publish rotation requirements (frequency, grace period). Engines Must expose hooks or automation to rotate secrets without redeploying workflows.\n- **Audit Logging** — Credential access events Should be logged with principal, reason, and outcome. When regulations demand it, engines Must redact sensitive fields while preserving forensic utility.\n- **Least-Privilege Defaults** — Workflows Should request the minimal scopes necessary. If a connector offers granular permissions, engines Must enforce least-privilege selection during binding.\n\n## 5.4 Rate Limits, Quotas, and Backpressure\n\nIntegrations live within operational constraints imposed by providers and internal policies. Workflows need declarative expressions of those constraints so engines can coordinate retries, backpressure, and graceful degradation without ad hoc scripting. These clauses equip operators with the dials they need to keep external services healthy while honoring business priorities when limits bite.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Constraint Specification** — Steps Must declare applicable limits: requests per interval, concurrent connections, cost budgets. Engines Must track consumption against these constraints and preemptively defer execution when thresholds are near.\n- **Backpressure Signals** — Engines Should emit standardized events (e.g., `rate_limit_imminent`, `quota_exhausted`) that downstream monitoring systems can observe. Workflows May subscribe to these events to trigger compensating actions.\n- **Retry Policies** — The specification encourages explicit retry policies with jitter strategies. Engines Must honor declared maximum retries and backoff windows, and Must escalate to fatal errors when policies are exhausted.\n- **Graceful Degradation** — Workflows Should declare degraded modes (reduced frequency, partial updates) when limits are hit. Engines Must transition into these modes deterministically and revert once constraints clear.\n- **Global Coordination** — In multi-tenant environments, engines May need shared state to enforce tenant-wide quotas. Shared coordination mechanisms Must maintain isolation boundaries and Must not leak tenant metadata.\n\nBy describing connectors, credentials, and operational constraints declaratively, the specification enables the same workflow artifact to run across different integration platforms while preserving security and compliance guarantees.

AI Interaction Model\n\n## 4.1 Model Invocation Contract\n\nAI steps sit on top of volatile providers whose behavior can change as models are retrained. To preserve interoperability and auditability, invocations need a predictable envelope that declares the capability being exercised, the resources involved, and the compliance constraints that apply. This paragraph frames the minimum metadata an engine must gather before it can call out to a model provider. Put differently, every call to an AI service should read like a signed work order—clearly stating what service is being requested, under what limits, and with which privacy guarantees—so that different vendors can fulfill it without guesswork.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Capability Declaration** — AI-centric steps Must declare the model capability they require (`language_model.generative`, `embedding.vectorize`, `vision.image_caption`, etc.). Runtimes Must map these capabilities to compatible providers or refuse execution with a deterministic error.\n- **Invocation Envelope** — Each AI invocation Must package the following fields: model identifier (or abstract class), version hint, input payload, control parameters, and metadata for tracing (correlation IDs, request origin). Providers lacking certain fields Must negotiate defaults before execution.\n- **Deterministic Inputs** — Inputs to AI models Must be fully deterministic after preprocessing. When upstream data is stochastic, the workflow Must include normalization steps (sorting, deduplication, canonical formatting) so the AI step receives a reproducible prompt structure.\n- **Resource Constraints** — Steps Must state resource requirements (max tokens, latency budget, cost ceiling). Engines Should enforce these via provider-specific limits and Must surface violations as recoverable errors with actionable diagnostics.\n- **Privacy and Compliance Flags** — AI invocations Must carry data classification markers (PII, PHI, proprietary). Execution engines Must ensure the selected model/provider meets the declared compliance requirements or abort prior to dispatch.\n\n## 4.2 Prompt Construction and Context Windows\n\nPrompt engineering cannot be left implicit—every engine must know how to assemble instructions, runtime context, and retrieved knowledge in a deterministic order. This subsection focuses on how prompt plans are declared, how context is trimmed, and how tools augment the conversation without surprising downstream steps. The goal is to let designers storyboard the conversational flow while giving implementers a reproducible recipe for stitching together instructions, retrieved snippets, and tool outputs.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Prompt Plan** — Workflows Must describe prompt composition using a declarative plan: system instructions, context blocks, user inputs, tool outputs, and formatting rules. Plans Should be modular to enable tooling-assisted editing and localization.\n- **Context Window Management** — Steps Must declare maximum context size and trimming strategy (e.g., recency-based, salience scoring). Engines Must apply the declared strategy deterministically and log truncation events for observability.\n- **Grounding and Retrieval** — When prompts depend on retrieved data, the workflow Must specify retrieval parameters (sources, filters, ranking) and Must mark retrieved snippets with provenance metadata so downstream steps can audit responses.\n- **Tool Augmentation** — Prompt plans May include tool call schemas (function signatures, slot constraints). Engines Must guarantee that tool invocation requests adhere to declared schemas and Must validate tool responses before reinserting them into the prompt stream.\n- **Multilingual and Multimodal Support** — Workflows Should specify language expectations and modality combinations (text, audio, image). Engines lacking required modality support Must reject execution unless a fallback path exists.\n\n## 4.3 Output Interpretation and Validation\n\nAn AI step is only useful if its outputs can be trusted by deterministic systems downstream. This clause defines the guardrails for validating responses, propagating uncertainty, and escalating to humans when automated repair cannot meet policy thresholds. Readers can think of this as the “quality control bay” where every AI response is inspected, polished, or escalated before it enters the production line of subsequent steps.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Structured Output Contracts** — AI steps Must specify expected output formats (e.g., JSON schema, regex template, XML). Engines Must enforce post-generation validation and trigger automated repair strategies (re-prompting, schema coercion) when validation fails.\n- **Confidence Attribution** — Outputs Should include confidence signals (model-provided scores, heuristic certainty). When available, engines Must propagate these signals so downstream steps can adjust behavior (e.g., request human review on low confidence).\n- **Safety Filters** — Workflows Must define safety criteria (disallowed topics, toxicity thresholds, bias mitigations). Engines Must run outputs through the declared filters and convert violations into recoverable or fatal errors per policy.\n- **Error Repair Loop** — Steps May define a structured repair loop: validation actions, re-prompt instructions, max iterations. Engines Must honor iteration caps to prevent infinite loops and log each repair attempt with rationale.\n- **Human Escalation Triggers** — The workflow Should declare conditions that escalate AI outputs to human reviewers (low confidence, high impact decisions, ambiguous classifications). Engines Must pause execution and collect feedback before proceeding.\n\n## 4.4 Adaptive Strategies for Nondeterminism\n\nEven with careful prompting, AI systems remain probabilistic. The specification therefore mandates explicit controls over randomness, caching, fallback paths, and drift monitoring so that operators can reason about changes over time and audit decisions after the fact. These controls give platform owners levers to keep behavior stable week-to-week and provide investigators a paper trail when outcomes diverge.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Determinism Envelope** — AI steps Must describe how nondeterminism is bounded: temperature settings, nucleus sampling thresholds, prompt randomization toggles. Engines Must enforce or simulate these settings when calling providers.\n- **Caching and Replay** — Workflows May request caching of AI responses keyed by prompt fingerprint. When enabled, engines Must check caches before new invocations and provide deterministic replay logs for auditing.\n- **Majority Voting and Ensembles** — For critical outputs, workflows Should support ensemble strategies (multiple model runs, cross-model voting). Engines Must orchestrate ensembles deterministically, capturing each member result and the aggregation decision.\n- **Fallback Models** — Steps May specify fallback providers when the primary model fails or violates policies. Fallback chains Must be acyclic and Must document capability differences so implementers understand behavioral shifts.\n- **Monitoring Drift and Degradation** — Workflows Should declare drift detection criteria (performance thresholds, distribution shifts). Engines Must emit telemetry aligned with these criteria and provide hooks for automated or human-triggered retraining/adjustment workflows.\n\nThese requirements ensure AI interactions remain predictable, auditable, and interoperable even as underlying models evolve. Annex B provides a worked customer-support triage example that demonstrates how the invocation, prompting, validation, and adaptation clauses work together in a real workflow.","src/content/ai-workflow-open-spec/05-ai-interaction-model.md","e7051393da14ffaf",{"html":157,"metadata":158},"\u003Ch1 id=\"4-ai-interaction-model\">4.

Human-in-the-Loop Mechanisms\n\n## 6.1 Review and Approval Nodes\n\nHuman participation is integral to AI workflows, whether for policy compliance, quality assurance, or creative direction. Review nodes must therefore be treated as first-class citizens: they pause execution, present curated context to reviewers, and resume based on explicit decisions. The specification defines how these nodes expose requirements so that any runtime can integrate with ticketing systems, inboxes, or custom review UIs while following the same state machine. In practical terms, these clauses ensure humans receive the right information at the right moment and that their choices feed back into automation without ad hoc integrations.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Review Schema** — Review nodes Must declare the data presented to humans, including payload excerpts, provenance metadata, and decision options. Schemas Should support role-based views so different reviewers see context aligned with their responsibilities.\n- **Decision Outcomes** — Each node Must enumerate possible outcomes (approve, reject, request_changes, escalate). Engines Must map reviewer input to these outcomes deterministically and log the identity of the decision-maker.\n- **Pause Semantics** — When a workflow enters a review node, the engine Must persist all prior state, mark the execution as paused, and emit notifications to configured channels. Timeouts or SLAs Should be attached to ensure pending reviews do not stall indefinitely.\n- **Resumption Protocol** — Upon receiving a decision, engines Must resume from the appropriate edge in the workflow graph. Rejections or change requests Should trigger compensating steps or alternative branches defined in the control flow.\n- **Accessibility Considerations** — Review nodes Should specify presentation guidelines (language, localization, accessibility metadata) so host applications can render inclusive experiences.\n\n## 6.2 Exception Handling Workbenches\n\nNot every incident can be resolved through a simple approve/reject choice. Some scenarios require operators to inspect system state, edit data, or rerun segments of the workflow. Exception handling workbenches provide structured environments for these interventions while preserving audit trails. You can think of them as dedicated “repair bays” where trained responders can adjust a workflow without bypassing governance controls.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Workbench Definition** — Workflows May declare dedicated workbench endpoints or applications. Definitions Must include required user roles, accessible data subsets, and permitted actions (edit, retry, escalate).\n- **State Snapshots** — When an exception is raised, engines Must capture snapshots of relevant inputs, outputs, and logs. Workbenches Should display these snapshots to operators to inform remediation without granting blanket system access.\n- **Action Authorization** — Every manual action Must be checked against the workflow's authorization model. Engines Must reject unauthorized edits and log attempted violations for forensic review.\n- **Rollback Hooks** — Workbenches Should offer hooks to trigger compensating steps or requeue items. Engines Must treat these hooks as part of the workflow graph, applying the same telemetry and error handling policies as automated steps.\n- **Collaboration Signals** — Definitions May include collaboration features (comments, assignments). Engines that support collaboration Must persist conversation threads alongside the workflow execution history.\n\n## 6.3 Escalation and Notification Channels\n\nTimely communication ensures that human checkpoints and exception paths do not become silent failure modes. The spec therefore mandates declarative escalation rules that engagement tooling can subscribe to, irrespective of the underlying messaging platform. These rules give operations teams predictable paging behavior, whether alerts surface in email, chat, or ticketing queues.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Channel Registry** — Workflows Must reference notification channels (email lists, chat rooms, ticket queues) by logical identifiers. Engines Must resolve these identifiers to concrete endpoints at deployment time.\n- **Escalation Rules** — Each human-involved node Should declare escalation paths based on timing, workload, or severity (e.g., escalate to on-call after 30 minutes, notify compliance officer on high-risk rejection). Engines Must enforce these timers even if the workflow is paused.\n- **Acknowledgment Tracking** — Engines Should track acknowledgment events from notified users and expose them in execution telemetry. Lack of acknowledgment within SLA Must trigger tertiary escalation.\n- **Audit Trails** — All notifications and escalations Must be recorded with timestamps, recipients, and payload summaries. Sensitive content Should be redacted per governance policy.\n- **Fallback Channels** — Workflows May define fallback channels for redundancy. Engines Must fail over deterministically when the primary channel is unavailable and report the failover in telemetry.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop mechanisms thus become composable workflow primitives, enabling consistent governance, auditability, and operator tooling across diverse automation platforms.

Core Workflow Abstractions\n\n## 3.1 Workflow Definition Envelope\n\nThe workflow definition envelope acts as the portable artifact that manufacturers, operators, and auditors exchange. It must tell the full story of what the workflow is, what it depends on, and how it should be governed, while remaining agnostic about the runtime that eventually executes it. Treat the envelope as the canonical representation—other projections (UI forms, SDK objects) should be derived views that can always be rehydrated into the envelope without loss. In practical terms, the envelope is the source of truth that travels between teams: product managers read it to confirm intent, engineers use it to wire implementations, and compliance reviewers inspect it to verify policy alignment.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Envelope Structure** — A workflow definition Must be represented as a single canonical document referencing stable identifiers for every component. The envelope Must include metadata (title, description, owners, version), declared capabilities, and a digest or hash to guarantee integrity.\n- **Versioning Semantics** — Each revision Must increment a monotonically increasing version marker and Must Not mutate previously published envelopes. Engines Should support semantic version hints (e.g., `major.minor.patch`) to communicate compatibility expectations.\n- **Capability Declarations** — The envelope Must enumerate required runtime capabilities (e.g., `language_model`, `http_request`, `human_review`). Engines Must reject execution if mandatory capabilities are absent and no fallback is declared.\n- **Policy Attachment** — Governance artifacts (compliance tags, access controls, retention policies) Should be attached by reference. When present, engines Must enforce them at execution time and emit attestations indicating compliance successes or violations.\n- **Localization and Internationalization** — The envelope May offer localized descriptors and human-readable instructions. Engines interpreting multiple locales Should expose a deterministic selection strategy.\n\n## 3.2 Step Types and Capabilities Catalog\n\nWorkflows draw from a shared catalog of step definitions, each describing what capability it exercises and how it should be executed. Maintaining a clean catalog is what allows different runtimes to swap handlers without rewriting the workflow spec. Think of step definitions as contracts between workflow authors and engine implementers—the catalog sets expectations up front and unlocks modularity when new capabilities arrive. Readers can imagine the catalog as a marketplace shelf: every item lists what it does, what inputs it expects, and the policies it obeys before anyone can place it on a workflow graph.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Step Definition Registry** — Steps Must reference definitions stored in a registry addressable by stable identifiers. Definitions Must contain: a unique key, descriptive name, supported capability tags, expected input/output schemas, runtime hints, and human-facing documentation.\n- **Capability Taxonomy** — The specification adopts a hierarchical capability taxonomy. For example, `language_model.generative`, `integration.http.get`, `human_review.decision`. Step definitions Must reference the most specific applicable capability. Engines May map capabilities to native handlers but Must preserve semantics.\n- **Extensible Catalog** — New step types May be introduced via extension modules. To maintain compatibility, extensions Must declare backwards-compatible defaults and explicitly state prerequisite profiles. Engines lacking an extension Must provide a deterministic refusal reason or an alternate execution plan if one is declared.\n- **Side-Effect Classification** — Each step definition Must declare its side-effect profile (`pure`, `idempotent`, `non-idempotent`). Runtimes Must respect these declarations when attempting retries, parallel execution, or speculative evaluation.\n- **Security Posture** — Steps Must articulate required security scopes (e.g., OAuth claims, API keys, dataset entitlements). Engines executing a step without the required scope Must raise a fatal error before external calls occur.\n\n## 3.3 Data Contracts and State Management\n\nTyped data contracts are the backbone of interoperability. They allow tooling to generate forms, validate payloads, and statically reason about what flows through each edge in the graph. Because AI systems can produce unpredictable outputs, the contracts do extra work: they wrangle stochasticity into predictable envelopes and describe the guardrails around state persistence. Without these contracts, teams would fall back to brittle string parsing or ad-hoc logging, which fails audits and shatters portability.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Schema Formalism** — Step inputs and outputs Must be described using machine-verifiable schemas (JSON Schema, Zod-compatible AST, Protocol Buffers, etc.). Schemas Must support references and composability so shared fragments can be reused across steps.\n- **Result Envelope Alignment** — Every step output Must conform to the Result Pattern, with a payload (`ok`) or structured error (`recoverable_error`, `fatal_error`). Errors Must include typed metadata (codes, human-readable summaries, remediation hints) to support automated routing.\n- **Context Propagation** — Workflows Must define how contextual state (e.g., workspace identifiers, user session data, correlation IDs) is passed across steps. Engines Should provide immutable system context (execution ID, timestamps) and Must prevent unauthorized mutation.\n- **State Persistence** — The workflow Must specify which fields require durable persistence between runs. Persisted state Should be versioned and Must include migration strategies when schemas evolve. Ephemeral state May be retained per execution but Must be garbage-collected according to policy settings.\n- **Data Sensitivity Classification** — Contracts Must annotate sensitive or regulated fields. Engines Must enforce protective measures (masking, encryption in transit, audit logging) consistent with the declared sensitivity level.\n- **Validation Lifecycle** — Inputs Must be validated prior to handler invocation. Outputs Must be revalidated before emission to downstream steps. Validation failures Must be surfaced as recoverable errors unless the specification explicitly marks them fatal.\n\n## 3.4 Control Flow and Orchestration Patterns\n\nWhile the workflow graph is declarative, engines still need clear guidance on how to interpret branching, looping, and compensation semantics. This subsection summarizes the canonical patterns and the constraints that keep them safe and debuggable across runtimes. The aim is to make orchestration behaviors readable enough for designers to storyboard and precise enough for implementers to build deterministic schedulers.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Sequential Flow** — Default execution is sequential along topological order. Steps Must execute only when all prerequisite edges resolve with `ok` or an allowed `recoverable_error` defined by policy.\n- **Parallel Branching** — Workflows May declare parallel branches by attaching multiple outgoing edges from a node. Engines Must preserve data isolation across branches and merge results only through explicit join nodes that define combination semantics.\n- **Conditional Routing** — Edges May include predicates referencing prior outputs or context fields. Predicates Must be expressed in a deterministic, declarative syntax (e.g., expression trees, JSON logic). Engines Must evaluate predicates atomically and log routing decisions.\n- **Loops and Iteration** — Iterative patterns Must declare termination criteria (max iterations, convergence condition, external signal). Engines Must enforce termination to prevent runaway execution and Should expose loop counters in telemetry.\n- **Compensation and Sagas** — For steps with side effects, workflows Should define compensation handlers. Compensation steps Must be idempotent and Must declare the scope of reversal. Engines Must invoke compensation when a transactionally grouped set of steps reaches a fatal error.\n- **Timeouts and Deadlines** — Each step May include a timeout. Engines Must enforce timeouts, aborting the step handler and emitting a recoverable or fatal error per policy. Workflows targeting strict SLAs Should declare global deadlines that engines respect when scheduling.\n- **Manual Interventions** — Control flow Must accommodate pausing at human-in-the-loop steps. When paused, engines Must persist all necessary context, notify subscribed channels, and resume only upon receipt of an explicit resolution event.\n\nThese abstractions collectively define how workflows are expressed independent of any specific runtime, while retaining enough structure for consistent execution semantics.","src/content/ai-workflow-open-spec/04-core-workflow-abstractions.md","1b30d02a6ea3f47a",{"html":212,"metadata":213},"\u003Ch1 id=\"3-core-workflow-abstractions\">3.

Reliability and Safety\n\n## 7.1 Observability, Logging, and Tracing\n\nTrustworthy automation depends on transparent execution. Observability must capture what happened, when, and why, without coupling the workflow to any specific monitoring vendor. This subsection defines the minimum telemetry envelope so engines can pipe data into their preferred stack while preserving cross-runtime comparability. Practitioners can treat these clauses as the “flight recorder” requirements that make post-incident reviews and audits possible.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Trace Context** — Engines Must propagate a trace context (trace ID, span ID, parent relationships) through every step, including human interventions and external connector calls. Context propagation Should follow industry standards (W3C Trace Context, OpenTelemetry) when available.\n- **Structured Logging** — Logs emitted by steps Must be structured (key/value, JSON) and tagged with workflow ID, step ID, execution ID, and result status. Engines Should allow workflow authors to declare PII redaction rules applied at log ingestion.\n- **Metrics and Counters** — Workflows Should define key performance indicators (latency, success rate, cost). Engines Must expose hooks to collect these metrics per step and aggregate them per workflow run.\n- **Event Timeline** — Engines Must maintain an ordered timeline of significant events (start, completion, retries, escalations) with timestamps and actors. Timelines Should be exportable for audit and replay scenarios.\n- **Telemetry Retention** — Retention periods Must align with governance policies. Engines Must support configurable retention and Must ensure deletion requests propagate to observability stores.\n\n## 7.2 Policy and Guardrail Enforcement\n\nAI workflows operate under legal, ethical, and operational constraints. Guardrails ensure that policies are enforced consistently, whether by automated filters or human oversight. This subsection describes how workflows declare guardrails and how engines must respond to violations, effectively codifying the rulebook that every automation run checks against before taking action.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Policy References** — Workflows Must reference applicable policies (e.g., content standards, data residency rules) using stable identifiers. Engines Must fetch current policy definitions at runtime or bundle them with the deployment artifact.\n- **Guardrail Types** — Guardrails May include content filters, risk classifiers, quota ceilings, or sandbox boundaries. Each guardrail Must specify enforcement mode (block, warn, route-to-human).\n- **Violation Handling** — When a guardrail triggers, engines Must emit structured events containing policy ID, offending payload metadata, and enforcement action. If the guardrail mandates a stop, the engine Must convert the step result into a fatal error and initiate compensating actions if defined.\n- **Policy Drift Detection** — Workflows Should declare how they detect policy drift (e.g., policy changes requiring review). Engines Must notify owners when referenced policies change in ways that could invalidate compliance assumptions.\n- **Override Protocols** — Some guardrails permit authorized overrides. Workflows Must document override procedures, including approver roles and logging requirements. Engines Must enforce multi-factor approval where specified.\n\n## 7.3 Error Handling, Retries, and Compensation\n\nEven with guardrails, failures happen. The specification mandates deterministic error categorization and recovery strategies so that different runtimes converge on the same behavior when steps misbehave or external systems degrade. Readers can view this as the emergency-response plan that keeps incidents predictable and recoverable.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Error Taxonomy** — Steps Must classify errors into `recoverable_error` or `fatal_error` with machine-readable codes. Engines Must maintain this classification end-to-end, ensuring recoverable errors feed retry policies while fatal errors trigger compensation or termination.\n- **Retry Policies** — Workflows Should declare retry backoff strategies per step (fixed, exponential, jitter). Engines Must honor retry limits and log each attempt with outcome. After exhaustion, the engine Must transition the step to `fatal_error` unless an alternate branch handles failure explicitly.\n- **Compensation Handlers** — For side-effecting operations, workflows Must specify compensation handlers or state that no compensation exists. Engines Must call compensation steps exactly once per failed transaction group and Must log their success or failure.\n- **Partial Failure Strategies** — When parallel branches yield mixed results, workflows Should define reconciliation rules (e.g., proceed if majority succeeds, otherwise trigger rollback). Engines Must evaluate these rules deterministically before continuing.\n- **Dead-Letter Queues** — Engines May route irrecoverable payloads to dead-letter queues. When they do, workflows Must define retention policies and remediation procedures for items in the queue.\n\n## 7.4 Testing, Simulation, and Validation\n\nBefore deployment, workflows need ways to validate their behavior under controlled conditions. This clause ensures that simulations, sandbox runs, and contract tests can be performed without modifying the production specification. The intent is to make testability a first-class concern, so teams can rehearse workflows the same way pilots run simulators before real flights.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Simulation Mode** — Workflows Should support a simulation profile that replaces external side effects with mocks or sandboxes. Engines Must honor simulation flags, ensuring no real-world mutations occur while logging simulated responses for analysis.\n- **Contract Tests** — Steps Must ship with contract tests or sample payloads that validate schema conformance. Engines Should provide tooling to execute these tests automatically during deployment pipelines.\n- **Fixture Management** — Simulation artifacts (sample prompts, API fixtures) Must be versioned alongside the workflow. Engines Must verify fixture compatibility with the current workflow version before execution.\n- **Scenario Coverage** — Workflows Should document key scenarios (happy path, guardrail violations, degraded mode). Engines May surface scenario templates to help operators define acceptance criteria.\n- **Continuous Validation** — Engines Must support scheduled validation jobs (canary runs, drift checks) and Must raise alerts when behavior deviates from expected thresholds.\n\nThese reliability and safety requirements ensure that workflows remain observable, governable, and resilient, even as models evolve and integrations change.

Preface\n\nAI agents are increasingly capable at sense-making, decision support, and narrative generation, yet production workflows still depend on programmatic nodes to guarantee determinism, compliance, and repeatable side effects. Without a shared specification bridging these worlds, teams either overfit to bespoke agent stacks or sacrifice innovation to keep predictable code paths intact. This document establishes that connective tissue: it shows how deterministic nodes and agentic AI steps can co-exist in the same automation, each playing to its strengths while sharing common guardrails for reliability, governance, and extensibility.\n\n## 1.1 Scope\n\nThis specification defines an implementation-agnostic contract for describing, executing, and governing AI-driven workflow automations. In plain terms, it is a common reference playbook that explains what information a workflow must declare, how automated and human steps interlock, and which safeguards keep runs dependable, regardless of the underlying tooling.

Preface\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>AI agents are increasingly capable at sense-making, decision support, and narrative generation, yet production workflows still depend on programmatic nodes to guarantee determinism, compliance, and repeatable side effects. Without a shared specification bridging these worlds, teams either overfit to bespoke agent stacks or sacrifice innovation to keep predictable code paths intact. This document establishes that connective tissue: it shows how deterministic nodes and agentic AI steps can co-exist in the same automation, each playing to its strengths while sharing common guardrails for reliability, governance, and extensibility.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"11-scope\">1.1 Scope\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This specification defines an implementation-agnostic contract for describing, executing, and governing AI-driven workflow automations.

It favors declarative intent over imperative scripts, capturing the semantics of modular steps, typed interfaces, and probabilistic AI behaviors in a portable artifact that can be interpreted by heterogeneous runtimes.

Annexes (Informative)\n\nThe annexes provide shared artifacts that accelerate adoption across ecosystems. They are informative rather than normative, but specifications should treat them as living references maintained alongside the core document. Each annex clarifies how to instantiate the patterns described earlier using concrete templates, vocabularies, or supporting materials. Readers can approach this section as the reference library: whenever a clause mentions “see Annex B” or similar, the supporting assets live here.\n\n## 10.1 Example Workflows\n\nExample workflows illustrate how the specification maps to real-world automations without binding implementers to a particular stack. They should showcase diverse scenarios—content moderation, lead enrichment, document summarization—highlighting how AI steps, human checkpoints, and integrations interact. These narratives bridge the gap between abstract requirements and day-to-day implementation choices.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Provide at least one end-to-end example per major profile (standard automation, regulated workflow, edge deployment).\n- Annotate each graph with capability usages, data contract references, and guardrail configurations.\n- Offer both narrative walkthroughs and machine-readable examples (YAML/JSON) to support tooling tests.\n\n## 10.2 Schema Definitions and JSON Examples\n\nReusable schema fragments prevent divergence across implementations. This annex aggregates canonical definitions for the Result Pattern, step metadata, connector descriptors, and audit events. Treat these artifacts as the shared dictionary that keeps different teams aligned on payload structure.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Publish schemas in an interchange format (JSON Schema Draft 2020-12, Protocol Buffers, or Zod AST export) with accompanying version markers.\n- Include positive and negative sample payloads for each schema to guide contract testing.\n- Note any optional fields and default behaviors so engines can validate partial payloads consistently.\n\n## 10.3 Glossary of Terms\n\nA shared vocabulary reduces ambiguity across human and machine consumers. The glossary should cross-reference the terminology introduced in Section 1.2 and expand with domain-specific phrases encountered during implementation. Glossary updates are also the fastest way to onboard new stakeholders who were not part of the original drafting team.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Maintain alphabetical order and include aliases or deprecated terms.\n- Link glossary entries to relevant clauses (e.g., \"Result Pattern\" → Section 3.3).\n- Capture distinctions between similar concepts (e.g., step vs. node, workflow vs. profile) to support onboarding materials.\n\n## 10.4 References and Further Reading\n\nWorkflow designers benefit from curated references to standards, best practices, and research. This annex aggregates material that influenced the spec or helps implementers deepen their understanding. The list should feel like a syllabus, guiding teams toward reputable resources when questions extend beyond the scope of the spec.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Cite related standards (OpenTelemetry, W3C Trace Context, RFC 2119), AI safety guidelines, and governance frameworks.\n- Organize references by theme (observability, ethics, model evaluation) for quick lookup.\n- Update the list as the ecosystem evolves, ensuring links remain accessible.\n\nWhile non-normative, the annexes form the knowledge base that keeps implementations aligned and equip teams to extend the specification responsibly. Maintaining them alongside the main clauses ensures the spec remains a living document rather than a static artifact.","src/content/ai-workflow-open-spec/11-annexes.md","39420bdc527a8405",{"html":322,"metadata":323},"\u003Ch1 id=\"10-annexes-informative\">10.

Extensibility Framework\n\n## 9.1 Extension Points and Module Registration\n\nThe specification must remain open to new models, connectors, and orchestration primitives. Extensibility hinges on clearly defined hooks where additional modules can register without modifying the core schema. This subsection outlines how extension authors declare themselves and how engines discover, validate, and sandbox these contributions. Readers can think of extensions as officially sanctioned add-ons: they snap into designated ports, announce their capabilities, and run within guardrails so core workflows remain stable.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Module Manifest** — Extensions Must publish a manifest describing provided step types, capability tags, configuration schemas, and compatibility ranges (core spec version, dependency versions). Manifests Should be signed or checksum-verified to prevent tampering.\n- **Registration Protocol** — Engines Must support a registration protocol (e.g., manifest import, plugin loader API) that validates manifests, resolves dependency conflicts, and activates extensions in a deterministic order.\n- **Sandboxing and Isolation** — Extensions that execute code Must declare security boundaries. Engines Must isolate extensions (process isolation, resource quotas) to prevent cross-workflow interference.\n- **Capability Bridging** — When extensions adapt external systems into existing capability categories, they Must document mapping semantics so workflows understand behavioral nuances compared to built-in implementations.\n- **Documentation Hooks** — Extension manifests Should include links to documentation, support contacts, and example workflows, enabling authoring tools to surface rich metadata to end users.\n\n## 9.2 Capability Negotiation and Feature Flags\n\nDifferent runtimes and extensions may support different feature sets. Capability negotiation ensures that workflows declare what they need, engines advertise what they offer, and both sides converge on a compatible set at execution time. This negotiation acts like a pre-flight checklist, confirming that the runtime and workflow agree on the features that will be used before the run takes off.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Negotiation Handshake** — Prior to execution, engines Must perform a handshake comparing workflow-declared capabilities against runtime-supported capabilities and enabled extensions. Incompatible workflows Must fail fast with actionable diagnostics.\n- **Feature Flags** — Workflows May gate experimental steps behind feature flags. Flags Must specify default states, rollout cohorts, and fallback behaviors. Engines Must persist flag evaluations per execution to keep behavior deterministic.\n- **Capability Downgrades** — When a requested capability is unavailable, workflows Should provide downgrade paths (alternate models, reduced functionality). Engines Must document which downgrade was applied and log the resulting behavioral differences.\n- **Runtime Capability Profiles** — Engines Should expose capability profiles describing the aggregate features available in each deployment environment. Workflows referencing a profile Must verify compatibility during deployment validation.\n- **Conflict Resolution** — If multiple extensions attempt to claim the same capability with different semantics, engines Must enforce precedence rules defined by policy (e.g., organization-specific allowlists) and Must surface conflicts to operators.\n\n## 9.3 Compatibility Guarantees and Deprecation Policy\n\nExtensibility is sustainable only if new capabilities do not break existing workflows. The specification therefore codifies compatibility expectations and a structured deprecation lifecycle so implementers can innovate without disrupting production automations. These clauses function as a treaty between extension authors and operators, spelling out how change happens without sacrificing trust.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- **Semantic Versioning** — Extensions and workflow bundles Must follow semantic versioning so consumers can infer compatibility. Breaking changes Must increment the major version and Must provide migration guides.\n- **Backward-Compatibility Tests** — Extension authors Should ship regression test suites covering supported spec versions. Engines incorporating extensions Must run these suites during upgrade workflows.\n- **Deprecation Announcements** — When retiring features, extension authors Must publish deprecation notices, timelines, and suggested alternatives. Engines Must propagate these notices to workflow owners and track remediation status.\n- **Compatibility Contracts** — The core specification Should publish compatibility contracts describing which versions of extensions or capability profiles are considered stable. Engines Must refuse to run combinations outside these contracts unless explicitly overridden.\n- **Fallback Guarantees** — Workflows May declare required fallback guarantees (e.g., must maintain data shape even when downgraded). Engines Must respect these guarantees or fail deployment if they cannot be met.\n\nBy formalizing extension points, negotiation, and compatibility rules, the specification stays adaptable while keeping cross-runtime behavior predictable.
