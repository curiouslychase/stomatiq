# Stomatiq

This repository contains the Astro implementation of the Stomatiq marketing site.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # start the local development server
npm run build    # build the static site into dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build locally

Astro ships the site as static HTML. Assets such as favicons live in `public/`, global styles in `src/styles/`, and page content in `src/pages/` and `src/content/`.
