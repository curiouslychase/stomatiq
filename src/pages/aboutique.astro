        Stomatiq is a consulting company dedicated to helping problem solvers
        leverage AI to design scalable solutions. Instead of focusing on AI as a
        novelty or personal productivity tool, Stomatiq equips people who want
        to tackle real problems—whether for communities, customers, or
        industries—with the frameworks and systems to deliver impact at scale.

        <p class="text-[15px] leading-7 text-foreground/70">
          AI isn’t just a tool for personal efficiency; it’s a platform for
          solving problems at scale. By automating routine complexity and making
          advanced workflows accessible, Stomatiq frees problem solvers to focus
          on context, creativity, and human judgment—where they add the most
          value.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Why Now</h2>
        <p class="text-[15px] leading-7 text-foreground/70">
          The AI era has unlocked unprecedented capacity for individuals to act
          at scale. But most problem solvers lack the frameworks and workflows
          to turn AI’s raw power into reliable, value-creating systems. Stomatiq
          fills that gap—helping them move from ideas to scalable solutions.

            Founder

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Chase Adams</h2>
          <p class="text-[15px] leading-7 text-foreground/70">
            Chase Adams is the founder of Stomatiq, where he helps problem solvers harness AI to design scalable
            solutions. He is also the cofounder of Plumb, a no-code platform for AI automation that empowers consultants
            and workflow creators to build powerful automations for their clients without writing code.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[15px] leading-7 text-foreground/70">
            Before starting Plumb, Chase built his career at the intersection of technology, consulting, and product
            development. He has worked across early-stage startups and fast-moving teams, consistently focused on
            helping people simplify complexity through better systems and tools. That perspective shaped his approach to
            Stomatiq: that AI isn’t meant to replace human insight, but to give problem solvers leverage to act at scale.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[15px] leading-7 text-foreground/70">
            Today, Chase combines hands-on technical expertise with a clear sense of human-centered design, equipping
            entrepreneurs, consultants, and innovators with the frameworks and systems needed to turn ideas into
            scalable impact.
