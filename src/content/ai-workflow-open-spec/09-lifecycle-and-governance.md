# 8. Lifecycle and Governance

## 8.1 Versioning and Change Management

Workflows evolve as policies shift, integrations change, or AI models improve. Managing that lifecycle requires explicit contracts for how changes are proposed, reviewed, approved, and rolled out. Without shared expectations, teams risk running outdated automations or introducing breaking changes without traceability. Think of this subsection as the change-management playbook that keeps every stakeholder synchronized when workflows move from draft to production.

Requirements:

- **Immutable Releases** — Published workflow versions Must be immutable. Subsequent edits Must produce new versions with unique identifiers, preserving historical artifacts for audit.
- **Change Manifests** — Each version Must include a change manifest highlighting modified steps, contracts, or policies. Manifests Should categorize changes as breaking, backwards-compatible, or experimental.
- **Approval Workflow** — Organizations Should define approval workflows (technical, policy, security reviewers). Engines Must verify that approvals are recorded before promoting a workflow to production environments.
- **Deprecation Policy** — When sunsetting a workflow, owners Must publish deprecation timelines and intended replacements. Engines Should assist by flagging executions past the deprecation window.
- **Rollback Plan** — Every change Must have a rollback strategy, documenting which prior version can be reinstated and what compensating actions are necessary if data has already been mutated.

## 8.2 Deployment Targets and Runtime Profiles

The same workflow may run in staging, production, or edge environments with different resource constraints or integrations. Runtime profiles make these differences explicit so the workflow artifact remains portable across deployments. These profiles give readers a menu of environment-specific behaviors so they can reason about how the same specification behaves in diverse contexts.

Requirements:

- **Profile Definitions** — Workflows May define named runtime profiles specifying target environment, connector variants, model selections, and policy overlays. Engines Must select a profile at deployment time and Must reject deployments missing required profile data.
- **Configuration Overlays** — Profiles Should express overrides declaratively (e.g., staging uses sandbox credentials, production uses service accounts). Engines Must apply overlays deterministically and log the resulting configuration.
- **Compatibility Checks** — Before deployment, engines Must validate that required capabilities, connectors, and secrets exist in the target environment. Missing prerequisites Must block deployment with actionable errors.
- **Progressive Rollouts** — Workflows Should support progressive rollout strategies (percentage-based, cohort-based). Engines managing rollouts Must track exposure metrics and provide rollback hooks if KPIs degrade.
- **Edge and Offline Modes** — When workflows target constrained environments (edge devices, offline processing), profiles Must specify resource budgets and offline behavior (batching, deferred synchronization).

## 8.3 Monitoring, SLA, and Compliance Requirements

Governance is incomplete without ongoing oversight. This clause captures how service-level agreements, compliance checks, and ownership metadata are declared so that operations teams can maintain accountability over time. In narrative terms, it spells out who is on the hook, what standards they watch, and how evidence is gathered to prove the workflow stays compliant.

Requirements:

- **Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)** — Workflows Should declare SLOs (latency, success rate, freshness). Engines Must monitor performance against these objectives and trigger alerts when thresholds are breached.
- **Ownership Metadata** — Each workflow Must specify accountable owners (team, role, contact). Engines Should integrate with incident management systems to route alerts accordingly.
- **Compliance Evidence** — Workflows operating in regulated contexts Must reference required evidence artifacts (risk assessments, DPIAs). Engines Must ensure evidence links remain accessible and Must notify owners when attestations expire.
- **Audit Scheduling** — Engines Should support scheduled governance checks (quarterly reviews, model bias audits). Workflows May provide checklists or scripts for auditors to execute.
- **Runtime Policy Enforcement** — Profiles Must codify runtime policies (region restrictions, data residency). Engines Must enforce these policies at execution time and Must log violations with sufficient detail for remediation.

Lifecycle governance ensures that once workflows are deployed, they stay aligned with organizational standards and legal requirements, even as AI components and integrations evolve. Annex F includes a release checklist example that walks through version promotion, profile selection, and compliance verification.
