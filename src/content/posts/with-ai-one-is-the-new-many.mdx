There's an old African proverb: "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

For the first time in human history, this is no longer true.

The physics of work, which has remained unchanged since the industrial revolution, just broke. A single person with AI can now go both fast and far.

We're living through the end of an assumption so basic we never thought to question it:

**Now we can go fast _and_ far alone.**

## The Last Law of Business Physics

Let's consider some of the major themes of the physics of business in the past 60 years.

    </p>
  </div>
</div>

These weren't just observations. They were constraints that shaped everything we built.

Every business book, every MBA program, every startup accelerator assumed the same truth: **meaningful work requires human coordination.**

The assembly line. The org chart. The Monday morning standup. All of it built on the premise that complexity requires collaboration.

**Until recently, when the last law fell.** There was no ceremony, no single moment.

Somewhere between ChatGPT's release and GPT-4's deployment, between Claude's emergence and Midjourney's v5, the phase transition happened. AI went from being an impressive demo to a day-to-day production teammate.

The constraints that governed all work since the industrial revolution quietly, and suddenly, dissolved.

## The Quiet Collapse

The shift happened when AI models became capable of using context from across an entire project. When you could feed Claude a 200-page requirements document and get back production-ready code. When Midjourney could maintain brand consistency across 100 images. When ChatGPT could remember your API structure through a six-hour debugging session.

Suddenly, the AI wasn't just helping, it was holding half the project in its context (or what we might call 'mind').

The cognitive load that used to require multiple humans to carry could now rest in a single context window. Not because the AI was smarter than those humans, but because it could be all of them at once. The designer who remembers every brand decision. The developer who never forgets an edge case. The analyst who keeps all the data relationships in working memory. This wasn't automation. It was multiplication. And the people who recognized it first didn't start working harder.

They'd escaped the need to work together.

# The Collapsed Team Theory

To understand what broke, we need to look at the equation that governed all work until now.

The traditional work equation was simple:

<div class="my-8 flex justify-center">
  <span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-2xl border border-foreground/15 bg-background-alt/40 px-6 py-4 text-center font-mono text-base font-bold uppercase tracking-[0.08em] text-foreground">
    Output&nbsp;=&nbsp;People&nbsp;×&nbsp;Coordination&nbsp;×&nbsp;Time
  </span>
</div>

More people meant more coordination complexity, which meant more time. The mythical man-month. The two-pizza rule. The scrum master. All attempts to optimize an equation that no longer governs.

The new equation:

<div class="my-8 flex justify-center">
  <span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-2xl border border-foreground/15 bg-background-alt/40 px-6 py-4 text-center font-mono text-base font-bold uppercase tracking-[0.08em] text-foreground">
    Output&nbsp;=&nbsp;Imagination&nbsp;×&nbsp;AI&nbsp;×&nbsp;Iteration&nbsp;Speed
  </span>
</div>

Every AI model is a collapsed team. Designer, developer, analyst, writer. Every role compressed into a single interface.

Every prompt is a meeting that doesn't happen. Every iteration is a decision without consensus.

A solo builder iterates 50 times per day. A team iterates twice per week.

The math is undeniable.

## The Architecture of One

What actually changed wasn't that AI automated tasks. It's that AI absorbed entire roles. The difference is everything.

Automation replaced hands. AI replaces minds. Not perfectly, not completely, but enough to break the fundamental requirement for human coordination. When you can summon a competent designer, developer, and copywriter with three different prompts, why manage three different people?

The _old bottleneck_ was coordination bandwidth: **How many people can you effectively manage?**

The _new bottleneck_ is cognitive bandwidth: **How many parallel processes can you orchestrate?**

Think about what this means. No translation costs between minds. No consensus tax on decisions. No coordination overhead. No politics. No alignment meetings. No status updates. No miscommunication.

Just pure intention meeting execution at the speed of thought.

## The Cognitive Load Revolution

We used to manage people. Now we manage intelligence. The shift is profound and mostly invisible.

Morning: You wake up to multiple AI assistants that worked through the night. Each one has been advancing a different aspect of your project. The designer has produced 30 variations. The developer has fixed the bugs you found yesterday. The analyst has processed the dataset. The writer has drafted the announcement.

Midday: You're in parallel conversation with six different AI models. Each conversation would have been a meeting. Each meeting would have required scheduling. Each scheduling would have taken three emails. The compound efficiency is staggering.

Evening: You've shipped what a team would call a sprint. Tomorrow you'll ship another one.

The tools dissolve into background. What remains is pure creative direction. You become an orchestra conductor, except every musician is perfectly obedient, never tires, and can play every instrument.

The strange realization: You're never alone (AI everywhere) yet always alone (no humans). The infrastructure of solitude.

## What Dies in the Death of Teams

It's important to acknowledge what we use in this new world, where one is the new many.

**Mentorship vanishes.** Who do you learn from when AI teaches everything? The junior developer who would have learned by watching you debug will never exist. The career ladder collapses into a single rung.

**Serendipity evaporates.** No more water cooler moments. No more accidental innovations from misunderstood Slack messages. No more "what if we tried..." conversations that spawn from casual Friday afternoon beers. Innovation becomes intentional, never accidental.

**Accountability disappears.** When you answer only to yourself, who pushes back on bad ideas? Who catches your blind spots? Who tells you the uncomfortable truths? AI will critique if prompted, but it won't grab you by the shoulders and tell you you're destroying the company.

**Purpose shifts.** Building with others creates meaning through shared struggle. Building for others creates meaning through service. But building by yourself, with only AI as witness? The existential weight is crushing. Every victory is celebrated alone. Every failure is borne alone.

The question no one wants to ask (or answer): **Is peak efficiency worth peak isolation?**

## The Uncomfortable Future

We're not going back. The competitive advantage is too severe.

Companies that require coordination will lose to individuals who don't. The next Fortune 500 company might be one person. The next Pulitzer might go to someone who's never met their editor. By 2027, it's been said that we'll see our first single-person unicorn. By 2030, they'll be common.

This isn't speculation. It's already happening. The consultant who replaced an entire firm. The creator who built a media empire from a bedroom. The developer shipping faster than funded startups.

**These solo builders are not outliers. They're early adopters.**

The S&P 500 was built on the assumption that scale requires size. _That assumption is dead._ Scale now requires focus, and focus is destroyed by coordination costs. The lone builder with perfect focus beats the distributed team every time.

The markets haven't priced this in. The education system hasn't adapted. The regulatory framework assumes employees. The tax code assumes payroll. Every institution is optimized for a world that just ended.

## The Infrastructure of Tomorrow

The new workspace isn't an office or even a home. It's a constellation of AI interfaces. Your team isn't on Slack; it's in system prompts. Your meetings aren't on Zoom; they're in context windows.

The workday isn't 9 to 5. It's whenever cognition meets ambition. The weekend doesn't exist because work no longer feels like work when friction approaches zero. The line between thinking and building dissolves.

Your competition isn't the company down the street. It's a teenager in Jackson, Wyoming with the same AI access you have. Geography is irrelevant. Bonafides are irrelevant. Experience is becoming irrelevant.

**The only thing that matters is the quality of your prompts and the clarity of your vision.**

This is what we didn't see coming: AI wouldn't replace workers. It would replace the need for workers to work together.

## The Choice That Defines the Next Decade

You can still choose teams. But it's now a choice, not a necessity. Like choosing to write by hand when keyboards exist. It's the more human choice. It's may also be the losing one.

Some will choose it anyway. They'll build companies with humans because they value the journey more than the destination. They'll accept moving slower because they prefer moving together. They'll become artisans in an age of automation, craftsmen in an era of generation.

But most won't. The gravitational pull of efficiency is too strong. The market rewards results, not methods. The solo builder who ships daily beats the team that ships monthly, regardless of how fulfilling their standup meetings are.

The real question isn't whether to go alone. It's what we'll become when connection is optional. When collaboration is a luxury, not a requirement. When the default state of work is solitude augmented by infinite intelligence.

I think about the young developers who will never experience the joy of shipping with a team. The designers who will never have their minds blown by a colleague's approach. The founders who will never know the bond forged through shared struggle.

And I think about what they'll build instead. Alone, unlimited, and unstoppable.

How far will you go alone? The answer might be: farther than we ever went together.

But the question that keeps me up at night isn't about distance. It's about destination. When we can go anywhere alone, will we still know where we're going? When we can build anything alone, will we still know what's worth building?

The infrastructure is ready. The tools are available. The old constraints are dead.

The only question left is whether we're ready for what we're becoming: a species that no longer needs each other to create, only to care.

## A Third Way: Teams Without Coordination

Despite everything I've just said about going alone, there's another model that I think has potential that's neither solo nor team. It's something new.

This possible third way is distributed creation without coordination overhead.

What does this look like in practice?

Instead of one person owning and orchestrating everything, they own and orchestrate major components of the business.

One person owns the API. One person owns the interface. One person owns customer operations. One person owns brand design. Not components or functions, complete domains with clear edges. Each person works alone with AI, at maximum velocity, but their outputs compose into something larger.

The designer owns everything visual. They own brand guide, marketing site, product UI, social presence. Not just making graphics, but owning the entire visual domain. The operations person owns the full customer journey. They own support, onboarding, documentation, communication.

**Complete ownership, clear boundaries, zero overlap.**

In this world, standups become less frequent or necessary. There's no blocking. There are no dependencies. Just clean contracts between black boxes, each box containing one human and infinite AI. The Unix philosophy applied to human organization: small, sharp tools that do one thing well.

This isn't delegation, it's federation. Each person is sovereign over their domain, shipping complete deliverables that others can use but can't block. When the API owner ships, the interface owner adapts. When the operations owner changes the onboarding flow, no one was waiting for approval.

**This only works with radical self-management.** The ability to own not just tasks but entire territories. To define your own edges and defend them. To know where your domain ends and another begins. The most important skill becomes the ability to architect and maintain boundaries.

The coordination happens through the work itself, not through meetings about the work. GitHub becomes the only meeting room. The shipped update becomes the only status update. The live product becomes the only source of truth.

Companies that figure this out will build with the speed of individual builders but the scope of teams. Not by working together, but by working in parallel. Not by coordinating, but by composing.

The future isn't solo. It's not traditional teams either. It's sovereign owners whose domains interlock without their calendars ever overlapping.

This model is being built right now, in real time, by people who got tired of asking permission. They're not waiting for the org chart to evolve. They're building the new org chart. The org chart where every box is a kingdom, every border is an API, and every person is exactly as powerful as their ability to ship.

The infrastructure exists. The math works. The only question is whether you'll keep scheduling meetings or start claiming territory.
