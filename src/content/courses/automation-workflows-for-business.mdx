# Automation Workflows for Business: Connect AI to Your Daily Operations

## From insight to action—automatically.

Learn to trigger business actions from AI-generated structured data: create CRM records, send personalized emails, file tickets, and update dashboards.

---

## What You'll Learn

**Example Flow:**
AI extracts customer info → Create CRM contact → Add deal → Send intro email → Post Slack summary.

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "name": "Jordan White",
    "email": "jordan@example.com",
    "company": "Northwind",
    "plan": "Pro"
  },
  "nextAction": "create_deal",
  "owner": "sales@company.com"
}
```
