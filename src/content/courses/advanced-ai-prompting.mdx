# Advanced AI Prompting: Chain Commands for Complex Workflows

## Turn big, messy tasks into simple, predictable steps.

Learn chain-of-thought prompting, role-based patterns, and multi-step orchestration—then combine the structured outputs to complete complex work with accuracy.

## What You'll Learn

**From One Giant Prompt:**
"Summarize these articles, extract the key metrics, and draft an email to my team."

**To Structured Steps:**
1) Extract metrics as JSON → 2) Summarize insights → 3) Draft email using the data.

```json
// Step 1 output
{
  "articles": [
    { "title": "A", "metric": 12 },
    { "title": "B", "metric": 35 }
  ],
  "highlights": ["growth in B", "seasonal dip in A"]
}
```

Use this in Step 2 and 3 to keep results consistent.
