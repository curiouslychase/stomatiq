## Description

Create a Technical Deep Dive article showing developers how to design modular, reusable blocks that compose into workflow engines.

## Details

**Category:** Technical Deep Dive
**Content Type:** Technical Deep Dive
**Voice & Tone:** Technical, architectural

### Goal
Show developers how to design modular, reusable blocks that compose into workflow engines.

### Structure
1. Context → brittle automations.
2. AI Shift → modular blocks with contracts.
3. Walkthrough →
   - Define inputs/outputs.
   - Create blocks (summarize, classify, transform).
   - Compose workflows.
   - Add logging + retries.
4. Pitfalls → over-generalizing, no monitoring.
5. Closing → this pattern scales automations into ecosystems.

### Checklist
- [ ] Defined workflow blocks
- [ ] Showed contracts/orchestration
- [ ] At least one code example

### Desired Outcome
Developers learn to build reusable workflow engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Clear block definition with inputs/outputs
- [ ] Code examples included
- [ ] Composition patterns explained
- [ ] Monitoring/logging guidance
- [ ] Voice matches style (technical, architectural)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved

## Changelog
