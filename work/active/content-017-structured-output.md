## Description

Create a Technical Deep Dive article explaining structured output: what it is, why it matters, when to use it, and how to implement it.

## Details

**Category:** Technical Deep Dive
**Content Type:** Technical Deep Dive (with Playbook Elements)
**Voice & Tone:** Technical but approachable

### Goal
Explain structured output: what it is, why it matters, when to use it, and how to implement it.

### Structure
1. Hook → "Free text is for humans. Structured output is for workflows."
2. Define → AI returns JSON/schemas instead of free text.
3. Why It Matters → reliability, composability, automation.
4. When to Use → chaining steps, integrating with tools.
5. How to Do → prompt JSON schema, use SDKs (OpenAI functions, Pydantic, Guardrails).
6. Pitfalls → hallucinated keys, rigid schemas.
7. Closing → structured output = AI as infrastructure.

### Checklist
- [ ] Defined clearly
- [ ] Examples of usage
- [ ] Pitfalls + fixes

### Desired Outcome
Readers know when and how to use structured output in their workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Clear definition with examples
- [ ] Use cases well-explained
- [ ] Implementation guidance with SDKs
- [ ] Pitfalls and solutions addressed
- [ ] Voice matches style (technical but approachable)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved
