## Description

Create a Future Laws & Frameworks article explaining how automation has evolved: tasks → workflows → adaptive systems, and what it means to move up the curve.

## Details

**Category:** Future Laws & Frameworks
**Content Type:** Future Laws & Frameworks (Every-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Visionary but simple

### Goal
Explain how automation has evolved: tasks → workflows → adaptive systems. Show readers where they are on the curve and what it means to move up.

### Structure
1. Hook → "We don't automate tasks anymore. We automate workflows. Soon, we'll automate entire systems."
2. Old Model → task automation (macros, Zapier).
3. AI Shift → workflows add flexibility + context.
4. New Model → adaptive systems.
5. Framework → the Automation Curve.
6. Implications → prosumers gain leverage like companies once had.
7. Thriving → how to move up the curve.

### Checklist
- [ ] Introduced the curve
- [ ] Defined each stage
- [ ] Added thriving guidance

### Desired Outcome
Readers locate themselves on the automation curve and feel motivated to move into workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Clear visualization of the curve
- [ ] Each stage well-defined
- [ ] Practical guidance for moving up
- [ ] Voice matches style (visionary but simple)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved
