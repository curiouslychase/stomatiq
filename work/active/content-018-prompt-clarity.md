## Description

Create a Future Laws & Frameworks article explaining that in the Director Era, communication isn't meetings or memos — it's prompts. Clear prompting is the new communication skill.

## Details

**Category:** Future Laws & Frameworks
**Content Type:** Future Laws & Frameworks (Every-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Bold, conceptual, memorable

### Goal
Explain that in the Director Era, communication isn't meetings or memos — it's prompts. Clear prompting is the new communication skill because it encodes intention for AI systems.

### Structure
1. Hook → "In the Director Era, your calendar is empty, but your prompt window is full."
2. Old Model → clarity mattered between people: memos, specs, meetings.
3. AI Shift → clarity now matters between human and system.
4. New Law → Output = Prompt Clarity × System Capability.
5. Implications → misunderstood prompt = failed meeting.
6. Examples → vague prompt vs clear structured prompt.
7. Thriving → prompting as communication infrastructure: templates, structure, iterations.
8. Closing → prompting isn't a hack, it's leadership's new language.
