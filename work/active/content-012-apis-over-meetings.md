## Description

Create a Future Laws & Frameworks article showing how AI workflows and APIs are replacing meetings and coordination costs, turning human processes into composable contracts.

## Details

**Category:** Future Laws & Frameworks
**Content Type:** Future Laws & Frameworks (Every-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Bold, provocative

### Goal
Show how AI workflows and APIs are replacing meetings and coordination costs, turning human processes into composable contracts.

### Structure
1. Hook → "The future org chart isn't people in boxes. It's APIs and workflows."
2. Old Model → meetings, consensus, calendars.
3. AI Shift → workflows replace coordination.
4. New Law → Coordination = Contracts, Not Conversations.
5. Examples → support triage, marketing-product syncs, finance reports.
6. Thriving → design personal APIs.
7. Closing → collaboration = composition, not coordination.

### Checklist
- [ ] Named the law
- [ ] 3 examples of workflows replacing meetings

### Desired Outcome
Readers reframe collaboration as API-driven, not meeting-driven.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Provocative hook that challenges assumptions
- [ ] Clear articulation of the new law
- [ ] Three concrete examples
- [ ] Practical guidance for designing personal APIs
- [ ] Voice matches style (bold, provocative)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved
