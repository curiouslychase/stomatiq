## Description

Create a Future Laws & Frameworks article showing how AI accelerates framework discovery by clustering, pattern-finding, and abstraction.

## Details

**Category:** Future Laws & Frameworks
**Content Type:** Future Laws & Frameworks
**Voice & Tone:** Visionary, meta, explanatory

### Goal
Show how AI accelerates framework discovery by clustering, pattern-finding, and abstraction.

### Structure
1. Hook → "Execution is abundant. Insight is scarce."
2. Old Model → frameworks developed slowly through experience.
3. AI Shift → AI accelerates pattern recognition and synthesis.
4. Why Frameworks Matter → compress complexity, multiply leverage.
5. How to Use AI → cluster themes, surface motifs, propose models.
6. Examples → business laws, productivity, market analysis.
7. Thriving → use AI to synthesize frameworks across domains.
8. Closing → those who co-create frameworks with AI define the next era.

### Checklist
- [ ] Named at least one new framework principle
- [ ] Gave 2–3 examples
- [ ] Provided practical thriving steps

### Desired Outcome
Readers understand AI as a partner in creating frameworks, not just executing tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Compelling hook that captures attention
- [ ] Clear examples of framework synthesis
- [ ] Practical AI usage guidance
- [ ] Voice matches style (visionary, meta, explanatory)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved

## Changelog
