## Purpose

**Mission**: Help readers recognize the future with AI and thrive in it.

Every piece should:
1. Reveal the structural shifts AI is causing
2. Offer clarity, guidance, or perspective on how to adapt

## Content Type

- [x] **Future Laws & Frameworks** (Every-style) → big ideas, reframing old assumptions, introducing new "laws of work"
- [ ] **Thriving Playbooks** (Cora-style) → practical, step-by-step guides for adapting to the new world
- [ ] **Human Side & Stories** → emotional, cultural, or case-study driven

## Core Idea

The Change-Impact Matrix: A 2×2 framework that maps situations along two axes:
- **Change axis**: None → Volatile (how rapidly things are shifting)
- **Impact axis**: Affects Me → Affects the System (scope of consequences)

This creates four distinct quadrants, each requiring different strategic responses in the age of AI disruption. The framework helps readers assess their position and choose appropriate actions.

## Why Now?

AI is creating both personal and systemic disruptions at varying velocities. People are paralyzed because they're using the wrong mental models - treating all change the same way. This framework gives them a diagnostic tool to:
- Identify what kind of change they're experiencing
- Choose appropriate responses rather than defaulting to panic or inaction
- Understand when to act personally vs. when to think systemically

## Target Audience

Curious professionals, builders, and creatives who sense the world is changing but don't yet have a clear map. Write for ambitious non-experts, not just technical insiders.

Specifically:
- Mid-career professionals facing AI disruption in their fields
- Leaders trying to navigate organizational change
- Builders deciding where to invest time and energy
- Anyone feeling overwhelmed by the pace of AI change

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

- **Smart but accessible**: like a conversation with a sharp, visionary friend
- **Memorable phrasing**: coin new terms, name new "laws," write tweet-worthy lines
- **Balanced awe and guidance**: recognize the drama of change, but always orient the reader toward thriving

## Outline

### Opening Hook
"You're standing in a river. The question isn't whether you'll get wet—it's whether you're in a gentle stream or approaching a waterfall, and whether you're alone or the entire riverbed is shifting beneath everyone."

Start with the disorientation people feel: some changes affect them directly but feel manageable; others feel systemic but abstract. The problem is we treat all change the same way.

### Main Sections

1. **Introducing the Matrix**
   - The two axes explained
   - Why this distinction matters in the AI era
   - Visual representation of the four quadrants

2. **The Four Quadrants**

   **Quadrant 1: Personal Stability (Low Change, Affects Me)**
   - Characteristics: Your world is relatively stable, changes affect you individually
   - Examples: Learning a new tool at work, adapting your workflow, skill refresh
   - Strategic response: Optimize and refine. Focus on personal mastery.
   - AI era twist: This quadrant is shrinking fast

   **Quadrant 2: Personal Disruption (Volatile Change, Affects Me)**
   - Characteristics: Rapid changes affecting you directly
   - Examples: Your role being automated, needing to pivot careers, personal skill obsolescence
   - Strategic response: Adapt quickly, build resilience, maintain optionality
   - Key insight: "Move faster than the disruption, but don't forget to look up"

   **Quadrant 3: Systemic Stability (Low Change, Affects the System)**
   - Characteristics: Stable systems that affect everyone
   - Examples: Industry standards, regulatory frameworks, established markets
   - Strategic response: Play the long game, build institutional knowledge
   - Warning: AI is moving many situations OUT of this quadrant

   **Quadrant 4: Systemic Volatility (Volatile Change, Affects the System)**
   - Characteristics: Rapid systemic shifts affecting entire industries/societies
   - Examples: AI transforming entire job categories, new economic models emerging, societal restructuring
   - Strategic response: Think in ecosystems, position for multiple futures, contribute to shaping the transition
   - The frontier: This is where the most leverage exists

3. **How to Use the Framework**
   - Diagnostic questions to identify your quadrant
   - Common mistakes (treating Q2 problems with Q1 solutions)
   - How to shift quadrants intentionally
   - Why you need different strategies for different quadrants simultaneously

4. **The Meta-Pattern: Everything Is Moving Up and Right**
   - AI is pushing situations toward higher change and broader impact
   - What used to be personal and stable is now personal and volatile
   - What used to affect systems slowly now reshapes them rapidly
   - The new skill: reading which quadrant you're in and acting accordingly

### Closing

"The map isn't the territory, but it helps you know whether to swim, build a boat, or redesign the river. In the age of AI, the answer is often: all three, in sequence."

Leave readers with:
- A clear mental model they can apply immediately
- Permission to use different strategies for different situations
- Confidence that understanding the terrain is half the battle

## Key Takeaways

What are the 2-3 core points readers should remember?
- Not all change requires the same response—the framework helps you diagnose which strategy to use
- AI is systematically moving situations toward higher volatility and broader impact (up and right on the matrix)
- The meta-skill is recognizing which quadrant you're in and shifting your approach accordingly

## Memorable Phrases

Any potential "laws," frameworks, or tweet-worthy lines to coin?
- "The Change-Impact Matrix" (framework name)
- "Move faster than the disruption, but don't forget to look up"
- "In the age of AI, everything is moving up and right"
- "The new skill isn't adapting—it's knowing which kind of adapting the moment requires"
- "Personal Stability," "Personal Disruption," "Systemic Stability," "Systemic Volatility" (quadrant names)
- Potential law: "The Law of Quadrant Migration: In exponential times, stability doesn't hold—systems and individuals drift toward volatility and broader impact"

## Category

- [x] New Laws of Work (physics of work)
- [ ] How to Thrive (playbooks & guides)
- [ ] The Human Side (meaning, psychology, culture)
- [ ] Field Reports & Stories (case studies, early adopters)
- [ ] Society & Institutions (education, regulation, systemic change)

## Research Needed

What do you need to validate, explore, or reference?
- Find 2-3 strong examples for each quadrant from recent AI developments
- Research existing 2×2 frameworks to ensure this is differentiated (BCG matrix, Eisenhower matrix, etc.)
- Validate the "everything moves up and right" thesis with concrete data/examples
- Identify quotes or case studies from people navigating each quadrant
- Consider: Are there situations that break the model? Edge cases to acknowledge?

## Success Criteria

How do you know this piece has landed well?
- Readers can immediately place themselves in a quadrant
- Comments/responses show people applying it to their specific situations
- The framework gets cited/referenced in subsequent conversations
- People create their own variations or extensions
- Tweet-worthy lines about the framework get shared
- Readers report feeling less paralyzed by change—they have a map
