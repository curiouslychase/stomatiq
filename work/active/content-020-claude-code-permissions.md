## Description

Create a Technical Deep Dive article showing developers how to configure Claude Code with sensible default permissions — safe enough to prevent harm, flexible enough to enable productive workflows.

## Details

**Category:** Technical Deep Dive
**Content Type:** Technical Deep Dive (Developer-Focused)
**Voice & Tone:** Technical, precise, pragmatic

### Goal
Show developers how to configure Claude Code with sensible default permissions — safe enough to prevent harm, flexible enough to enable productive workflows.

### Structure
1. Hook → "Claude Code is powerful, but with great power comes great risk."
2. Context → Claude Code can run commands, edit files, and manage directories.
3. Principle → sensible defaults = balance of safety + freedom.
4. Example Config → show JSON block of allow, deny, ask.
5. Walkthrough →
   - Allow = safe everyday commands.
   - Deny = destructive/system-level.
   - Ask = sensitive but situational.
6. Why It Matters → prevents accidents, protects sensitive files, creates trust.
7. When to Adjust →
   - Tighten for production.
   - Loosen for local experiments.
   - Keep core deny rules.
8. Closing → permissions don't slow you down — they create confidence.
