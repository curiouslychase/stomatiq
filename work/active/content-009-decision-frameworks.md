## Description

Create a Future Laws & Frameworks article showing that in the one-person unicorn era, you thrive by creating **decision frameworks** rather than making every decision yourself.

## Details

**Category:** Future Laws & Frameworks
**Content Type:** Future Laws & Frameworks (Every-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Visionary and practical

### Goal
Show readers that in the one-person unicorn era, you can't scale by making every decision yourself. Instead, you thrive by creating **decision frameworks** — rubrics, principles, and systems that make the right choices self-evident.

### Structure
1. Hook → "Decisions don't scale. Frameworks do."
2. Old Assumption → leaders scale by making more/faster decisions.
3. AI Shift → solo builders face too many decisions; fatigue is the bottleneck.
4. New Law → Output = Decisions × Quality × Consistency → broken.
   New → Frameworks encode judgment and scale.
5. Examples → hiring rubric, brand principles, prompt templates.
6. Thriving → steps to identify recurring decisions → abstract → encode → iterate.
7. Closing → frameworks are leverage; decisions are drag.

### Checklist
- [ ] Defined the law
- [ ] Provided concrete examples
- [ ] Clear thriving steps

### Desired Outcome
Readers see that **scaling means encoding judgment into frameworks** instead of making decisions ad hoc.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Powerful hook that reframes decision-making
- [ ] Clear explanation of the new law
- [ ] Concrete, actionable examples
- [ ] Step-by-step thriving guidance
- [ ] Voice matches style (visionary and practical)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved
