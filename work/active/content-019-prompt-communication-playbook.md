## Description

Create a Thriving Playbook article teaching readers how to write clear, structured prompts so their AI workflows run reliably. Position prompting as communication, not tricks.

## Details

**Category:** Thriving Playbook
**Content Type:** Thriving Playbook (Cora-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Practical, empowering, precise

### Goal
Teach readers how to write clear, structured prompts so their AI workflows run reliably. Position prompting as communication, not tricks.

### Structure
1. Context → bad prompts = misaligned outputs = wasted cycles.
2. Promise → a toolkit for clarity.
3. Principles →
   - Write for the system.
   - Encode rubrics.
   - Clarity > cleverness.
4. Steps →
   - Define intent.
   - Structure output.
   - Add context.
   - Iterate fast.
   - Standardize templates.
5. Mistakes → vagueness, overstuffing, forgetting output formats.
6. Closing → prompting is communication infrastructure.
