## Description

Create a Thriving Playbook article showing readers how to design their workday around **state changes** and orchestration of AI agents instead of focus blocks or meetings.

## Details

**Category:** Thriving Playbook
**Content Type:** Thriving Playbook (Cora-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Practical, empowering

### Goal
Show readers how to design their workday around **state changes** and orchestration of AI agents instead of focus blocks or meetings.

### Structure
1. Context → maker = focus blocks, manager = meetings.
2. Director Shift → work = orchestrating parallel processes.
3. Steps →
   - Define desired outcomes.
   - Spin up parallel agents.
   - Intervene with state changes, not continuous presence.
   - Review, adjust, re-orchestrate.
4. Mistakes → micromanaging agents, not giving context.
5. Closing → your day becomes directing flows, not clocking hours.
