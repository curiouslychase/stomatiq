## Description

Create a Thriving Playbook article to help readers reframe "craft" when they no longer directly manipulate materials, but orchestrate instead.

## Details

**Category:** Thriving Playbook
**Content Type:** Thriving Playbook
**Voice & Tone:** Reflective, empathetic, empowering

### Goal
Help readers reframe "craft" when they no longer directly manipulate materials, but orchestrate instead.

### Structure
1. Context → loss of maker satisfaction.
2. Director Shift → craft becomes orchestration.
3. Practices →
   - Treat orchestration as design.
   - Celebrate outcomes, not processes.
   - Reflect on meta-craft (systems, principles).
4. Closing → meaning comes from direction, not just making.

### Checklist
- [ ] Named the loss of craft
- [ ] Offered reframes and practices

### Desired Outcome
Readers accept orchestration as a new form of craft.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Acknowledges emotional aspects of craft loss
- [ ] Provides meaningful reframes
- [ ] Practical exercises for finding meaning in orchestration
- [ ] Voice matches style (reflective, empathetic, empowering)
