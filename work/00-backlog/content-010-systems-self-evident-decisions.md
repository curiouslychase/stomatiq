## Description

Create a Thriving Playbook article helping readers design systems (rubrics, principles, checklists, and AI prompts) that make the right decisions **self-evident and repeatable**.

## Details

**Category:** Thriving Playbook
**Content Type:** Thriving Playbook (Cora-style)
**Voice & Tone:** Practical, empowering, clear

### Goal
Help readers design systems (rubrics, principles, checklists, and AI prompts) that make the right decisions **self-evident and repeatable**, so they don't waste energy on decision fatigue.

### Structure
1. Context → solo builders can't scale by making every decision.
2. Promise → show how to create systems that make decisions automatic.
3. Principles → decisions are drag, frameworks are leverage.
4. Steps →
   - Identify recurring decisions.
   - Abstract into criteria.
   - Encode into prompts/checklists.
   - Add guardrails.
   - Test + refine.
5. Mistakes → over-engineering, vagueness, no iteration.
6. Closing → once decisions are self-evident, you focus on direction, not drag.

### Checklist
- [ ] Explained why self-evident systems matter
- [ ] Gave at least one concrete example
- [ ] Walked through steps

### Desired Outcome
Readers leave knowing how to design **one small system** (rubric, checklist, AI prompt) to reduce decision fatigue today.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article follows the defined structure
- [ ] Clear step-by-step process
- [ ] Concrete example included
- [ ] Common mistakes addressed
- [ ] Voice matches style (practical, empowering, clear)
- [ ] Desired outcome is achieved
