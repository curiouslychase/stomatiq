# Building Your AI Orchestra

**Category:** AI Workflow Automation

## Why This Next

Both posts describe parallel AI execution in theory but don't show the mechanics. Readers need to know: *How do I actually set up multiple AI agents working simultaneously?*

## Links From

- Director equation and parallel processes concepts
- The collapsed team theory and iteration speed comparisons
- "Orchestrating outcomes across multiple AI agents" (line 188 of maker schedule)

## Key Angles

- Practical setup for running multiple AI agents in parallel
- Tool combinations that enable orchestration
- How to maintain coherent vision across parallel threads
- Managing context between different AI conversations
- When to use which model for which task
- Real examples of multi-agent workflows

## Reader Outcome

Leave with a clear understanding of how to architect and run parallel AI workstreams, with specific tools and patterns they can implement immediately.
