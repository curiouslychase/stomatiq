## Purpose

**Mission**: Help readers recognize the future with AI and thrive in it.

Every piece should:
1. Reveal the structural shifts AI is causing
2. Offer clarity, guidance, or perspective on how to adapt

## Content Type

Choose one:
- [ ] **Future Laws & Frameworks** (Every-style) → big ideas, reframing old assumptions, introducing new "laws of work"
- [ ] **Thriving Playbooks** (Cora-style) → practical, step-by-step guides for adapting to the new world
- [ ] **Human Side & Stories** → emotional, cultural, or case-study driven

## Core Idea

What's the central insight or framework? What will readers walk away remembering?

## Why Now?

Why does this matter right now? What shift or pattern makes this timely?

## Target Audience

Curious professionals, builders, and creatives who sense the world is changing but don't yet have a clear map. Write for ambitious non-experts, not just technical insiders.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

- **Smart but accessible**: like a conversation with a sharp, visionary friend
- **Memorable phrasing**: coin new terms, name new "laws," write tweet-worthy lines
- **Balanced awe and guidance**: recognize the drama of change, but always orient the reader toward thriving
