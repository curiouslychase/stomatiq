# 7. Reliability and Safety

## 7.1 Observability, Logging, and Tracing

Trustworthy automation depends on transparent execution. Observability must capture what happened, when, and why, without coupling the workflow to any specific monitoring vendor. This subsection defines the minimum telemetry envelope so engines can pipe data into their preferred stack while preserving cross-runtime comparability. Practitioners can treat these clauses as the “flight recorder” requirements that make post-incident reviews and audits possible.

Requirements:

- **Trace Context** — Engines Must propagate a trace context (trace ID, span ID, parent relationships) through every step, including human interventions and external connector calls. Context propagation Should follow industry standards (W3C Trace Context, OpenTelemetry) when available.
- **Structured Logging** — Logs emitted by steps Must be structured (key/value, JSON) and tagged with workflow ID, step ID, execution ID, and result status. Engines Should allow workflow authors to declare PII redaction rules applied at log ingestion.
- **Metrics and Counters** — Workflows Should define key performance indicators (latency, success rate, cost). Engines Must expose hooks to collect these metrics per step and aggregate them per workflow run.
- **Event Timeline** — Engines Must maintain an ordered timeline of significant events (start, completion, retries, escalations) with timestamps and actors. Timelines Should be exportable for audit and replay scenarios.
- **Telemetry Retention** — Retention periods Must align with governance policies. Engines Must support configurable retention and Must ensure deletion requests propagate to observability stores.

## 7.2 Policy and Guardrail Enforcement

AI workflows operate under legal, ethical, and operational constraints. Guardrails ensure that policies are enforced consistently, whether by automated filters or human oversight. This subsection describes how workflows declare guardrails and how engines must respond to violations, effectively codifying the rulebook that every automation run checks against before taking action.

Requirements:

- **Policy References** — Workflows Must reference applicable policies (e.g., content standards, data residency rules) using stable identifiers. Engines Must fetch current policy definitions at runtime or bundle them with the deployment artifact.
- **Guardrail Types** — Guardrails May include content filters, risk classifiers, quota ceilings, or sandbox boundaries. Each guardrail Must specify enforcement mode (block, warn, route-to-human).
- **Violation Handling** — When a guardrail triggers, engines Must emit structured events containing policy ID, offending payload metadata, and enforcement action. If the guardrail mandates a stop, the engine Must convert the step result into a fatal error and initiate compensating actions if defined.
- **Policy Drift Detection** — Workflows Should declare how they detect policy drift (e.g., policy changes requiring review). Engines Must notify owners when referenced policies change in ways that could invalidate compliance assumptions.
- **Override Protocols** — Some guardrails permit authorized overrides. Workflows Must document override procedures, including approver roles and logging requirements. Engines Must enforce multi-factor approval where specified.

## 7.3 Error Handling, Retries, and Compensation

Even with guardrails, failures happen. The specification mandates deterministic error categorization and recovery strategies so that different runtimes converge on the same behavior when steps misbehave or external systems degrade. Readers can view this as the emergency-response plan that keeps incidents predictable and recoverable.

Requirements:

- **Error Taxonomy** — Steps Must classify errors into `recoverable_error` or `fatal_error` with machine-readable codes. Engines Must maintain this classification end-to-end, ensuring recoverable errors feed retry policies while fatal errors trigger compensation or termination.
- **Retry Policies** — Workflows Should declare retry backoff strategies per step (fixed, exponential, jitter). Engines Must honor retry limits and log each attempt with outcome. After exhaustion, the engine Must transition the step to `fatal_error` unless an alternate branch handles failure explicitly.
- **Compensation Handlers** — For side-effecting operations, workflows Must specify compensation handlers or state that no compensation exists. Engines Must call compensation steps exactly once per failed transaction group and Must log their success or failure.
- **Partial Failure Strategies** — When parallel branches yield mixed results, workflows Should define reconciliation rules (e.g., proceed if majority succeeds, otherwise trigger rollback). Engines Must evaluate these rules deterministically before continuing.
- **Dead-Letter Queues** — Engines May route irrecoverable payloads to dead-letter queues. When they do, workflows Must define retention policies and remediation procedures for items in the queue.

## 7.4 Testing, Simulation, and Validation

Before deployment, workflows need ways to validate their behavior under controlled conditions. This clause ensures that simulations, sandbox runs, and contract tests can be performed without modifying the production specification. The intent is to make testability a first-class concern, so teams can rehearse workflows the same way pilots run simulators before real flights.

Requirements:

- **Simulation Mode** — Workflows Should support a simulation profile that replaces external side effects with mocks or sandboxes. Engines Must honor simulation flags, ensuring no real-world mutations occur while logging simulated responses for analysis.
- **Contract Tests** — Steps Must ship with contract tests or sample payloads that validate schema conformance. Engines Should provide tooling to execute these tests automatically during deployment pipelines.
- **Fixture Management** — Simulation artifacts (sample prompts, API fixtures) Must be versioned alongside the workflow. Engines Must verify fixture compatibility with the current workflow version before execution.
- **Scenario Coverage** — Workflows Should document key scenarios (happy path, guardrail violations, degraded mode). Engines May surface scenario templates to help operators define acceptance criteria.
- **Continuous Validation** — Engines Must support scheduled validation jobs (canary runs, drift checks) and Must raise alerts when behavior deviates from expected thresholds.

These reliability and safety requirements ensure that workflows remain observable, governable, and resilient, even as models evolve and integrations change. Annex E documents a post-incident review checklist that illustrates how the observability, guardrail, and testing clauses work together during real-world investigations.
