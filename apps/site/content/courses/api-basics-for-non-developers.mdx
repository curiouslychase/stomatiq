# API Basics for Non-Developers: Connect Any Tool to Anything

## Finally understand APIs—without code.

APIs are how modern tools talk to each other. In this course, you’ll learn the essentials in plain English and start moving structured data between your tools using platforms like Zapier, Make.com, and native integrations.

---

## What You'll Learn

**From Confusion:**
"I have data in Google Sheets and want to send it to Slack and my CRM, but I don’t know what an endpoint or a webhook is."

**To Confidence:**
You’ll be able to read a basic API doc, send a request, handle a response, and wire it into an automation.

```http
POST https://api.example.com/v1/contacts
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "Alex",
  "lastName": "Nguyen",
  "email": "alex@example.com",
  "tags": ["newsletter", "lead"]
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "c_9a12f",
  "status": "created"
}
```
