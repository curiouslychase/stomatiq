# Data Validation & Quality Control: Ensure Your AI Data is Accurate

## Structured is good. Accurate is better.

AI can produce confident—but wrong—answers. This course teaches you how to verify, clean, and validate AI-generated data before it hits your systems.

---

## What You'll Learn

**From Risk:**
Accepting any JSON that "looks right" and discovering bad records later.

**To Reliability:**
Automatic checks that block incorrect data and prompt fixes.

```json
// Example: Validate with a simple schema
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
    "amount": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
    "date": { "type": "string", "format": "date" }
  },
  "required": ["email", "amount", "date"]
}
```
